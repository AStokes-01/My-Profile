<h2>My Intrest In IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT came at a young age, playing Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2. Since then I have been interested in computers and gaming. I have been working in hospitality for 9 years now and I want to change careers to something more enjoyable and viable, I believe that IT is the future of the world and having skills and a career in IT will benefit me greatly.

<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
<p>My ideal job in the IT industry would be as a Full Stack Developer. Working to the Software Development Life Cycle (or SDLC) I would be designing websites to the client’s requirements, using creativity and programming to design solutions to my clients needs. Modifying and writing code, solving problems by testing the code methodically for bugs and using logic to apply fixes. It is my goal to develop the necessary skills such as being proficient with JavaScript programing, HTML, CSS, Node.JS and C# programming to name a few.

<h2>My Personality & learning types</h2>
<p>My personality type is Turbulent Logician or INTP-T; Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking and Prospecting. This means that I am innovative, resourceful, and hardworking which I think couples well with my learning type, Kinesthetic which is a hands-on, learning by doing way or learning. While being introverted I can work strongly in a team through communication, effort and unrelenting loyalty to the cause. I am also a big believer of having fun while working with in a team, my ideal team would be able to get along and have a laugh and at the same time, knuckle down and work hard.<hr>
